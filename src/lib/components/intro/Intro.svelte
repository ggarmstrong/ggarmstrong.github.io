			I have fun building software with smart and passionate people. It's my continuing goal to
			improve the ui/ux quality of my work while also growing my full-stack capabilities. I enjoy
			working through the interplay between dev theory and real-world business requirements.

			I'm particularly interested in assembling, integrating, and evolving resilient
			component-driven design systems. I'm inspired by leaders in this field, and I promote
			design-system-first dev/testing workflows in order to help improve products and brands.
